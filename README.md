# Project Analysis

## Overview

This project involves analyzing screen time data using the Pandas library in Python. The main components of the project include a Jupyter notebook and a CSV file containing screen time statistics.

## Components

1. **Jupyter Notebook (`1.ipynb`)**: This notebook contains the code for data manipulation and analysis using Pandas. It includes:

   - Importing the Pandas library.
   - Creating a DataFrame from a list of cities.
   - Displaying DataFrame information and shape.

2. **CSV File (`Screen Time Data.csv`)**: This file contains screen time data with the following columns:
   - `index`: Row index.
   - `Date`: The date of the record.
   - `Week Day`: The day of the week.
   - `Total Screen Time`: Total screen time in minutes.
   - `Social Networking`: Time spent on social networking.
   - `Reading and Reference`: Time spent on reading and reference materials.
   - `Other`: Other screen time activities.
   - `Productivity`: Time spent on productive tasks.
   - `Health and Fitness`: Time spent on health and fitness activities.
   - `Entertainment`: Time spent on entertainment.
   - `Creativity`: Time spent on creative activities.
   - `Yoga`: Time spent on yoga.

## Analysis Goals

- To analyze the total screen time and its distribution across different activities.
- To visualize trends in screen time over the recorded dates.
- To derive insights on productivity and leisure activities based on screen time data.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide insights into screen time habits and their implications on productivity and well-being. Further analysis can be conducted to explore correlations between different activities and overall screen time.
